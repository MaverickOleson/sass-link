This package was made with component based structure for your website design needs. It looks for scss partials (_name.scss) in every folder available and import them all into a styles.scss file it creates, which you can compile into one singular css file! No more having to find your partials manually write down import statements with precise links! It also watches for deletions and creations of partials as well! Now, you can have partials ANYWHERE, and they'll all neatly show up in one place for you to use. Note: it's best to use this in a folder that does NOT contain any large subfolders in it, or the command will take a while to execute.
